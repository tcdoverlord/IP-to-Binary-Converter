IP to Binary Converter
Overview
This project is an IP to Binary Converter designed to simplify the process of converting IPv4 addresses into their binary equivalent. It provides users with:
•	The ability to validate and convert IP addresses into binary format.
•	The option to copy the full binary output or specific sections (octets).
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this tool combines functionality with a user-friendly interface.

Features
•	Accurate Conversion: Transforms valid IPv4 addresses into a binary representation with 8-bit formatting for each octet.
•	Section-Wise Copy Options: Allows users to copy either the full binary output or any individual section for convenience.
•	Input Validation: Ensures only valid IPv4 addresses are processed and provides feedback for incorrect inputs.
•	Interactive Design: Simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for both developers and non-technical users.
